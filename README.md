## What is WNFT
This management Web App is an interface to the [WNFT smart contract](https://github.com/Esteroids/WNFT-contract).


A WNFT is a concept of a website, where some areas of the website are controlled by an NFT. 

Before WNFT, We always thought of websites as "one object", with all the pages belonging to one person (or one company), and each webpage is seen as one object.

However, in WNFT we look at websites as a *collection of independent objects*, each object is owned by a different person. In WNFT, not only that each webpage is a separate object, but even each *area* in a webpage is an object.

In our implementation of WNFT, we represent each area in each webpage by an NFT token. The person who owns this token controls what is shown in this area. To create harmony in the website, all the holders of the tokens will govern the website together.
